# @taujs/server

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#25](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/25) [`0e7186c`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/0e7186cfa1a257178a629e0bb19f5c3dfa69e185) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - Declared Vite customisation surface (RFC 0005): one config file owns the whole Vite surface, applied symmetrically to dev and build.

  - `config.vite` - a new first-class field on `taujs.config.ts`, typed as an allowlisted `TaujsViteConfig` (or a `(ctx) => TaujsViteConfig` function form receiving a discriminated serve/build context). Admitted fields (`plugins`, `define`, `css.preprocessorOptions`, `esbuild`, `logLevel`, dev-only `optimizeDeps`, non-`alias` `resolve`, and build tuning such as `build.sourcemap`/`minify`/`rollupOptions.external`/`output.manualChunks`) now reach the shared dev server and every production build through one merge engine and one precedence chain (framework invariants -> `config.vite` -> `taujsBuild({ vite })`).
  - `config.alias` - the declarative home for aliases, sourced by both dev and build. Relative values normalise against the project root; absolute values pass through. The programmatic `createServer({ alias })` and `taujsBuild({ alias })` options remain as escape hatches, layered on top.
  - `configFile: false` is now pinned in both dev and build, so no stray `vite.config.*` is ever auto-discovered. A `vite.config.*` left in a formerly probed location (the client base root or a per-entry root) triggers a targeted migration warning at dev boot and at build start, naming the file and pointing at the `config.vite` recipe. Project-root files were never read and are exempt.
  - Plugin composition rule (dev and build): concatenate in declared order, dedupe by plugin name with the first occurrence winning, and report every cross-source collision once at warn level with the name, each declaring source, and the winner. The `τjs-` framework prefix is reserved - a user plugin carrying it is dropped with a warning. Cross-app plugin collisions in the shared dev server are promoted from debug to warn.
  - Protected-field warnings: supplying a framework-owned field (`root`, `base`, `publicDir`, `configFile`, `server.*`, `appType`, `build.outDir`/`ssr`/`ssrManifest`/`format`/`target`/`manifest`, `rollupOptions.input`, `resolve.alias`) through the override channels is rejected and logged at warn in both dev and build, never silently applied or dropped. The typed `TaujsViteConfig` surface excludes these, so only a JS config or `as any` cast can reach the runtime guard.
  - `optimizeDeps` is a development-only subset (`include`/`exclude`/`esbuildOptions`); the same package in both `include` and `exclude` is a config-validation error, and nothing from `optimizeDeps` reaches production builds.
  - Fix: multi-app builds are now ordered parent-first (root app before named entry points), so a root app declared after a named MFE no longer empties `dist/client`/`dist/ssr` and deletes the MFE's already-emitted output. Per-app `emptyOutDir` behaviour is unchanged. The reorder is ancestry-aware and minimal: an app moves only to sit immediately before the first app whose output directory it contains (ancestry derived from resolved paths, so non-canonical entry points such as trailing-slash parents order correctly). An ancestor moves immediately before its first already-placed descendant, crossing unrelated apps when required; otherwise declared order - which callback and plugin execution observe - is retained, and a collection containing no ancestry relationships is never reordered.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#21](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/21) [`3e69316`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/3e693165c523b598e434eee55acc8a3c8b99735b) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - RFC 0004 (H1): routes may declare `attr.head = { data, timeoutMs?, optional? }` - a dynamic head
  data loader resolved BEFORE the renderer starts on BOTH strategies and delivered to the renderer
  as `opts.headData` (an additive optional field on the `RenderSSR`/`RenderStream` contracts). This
  gives streamed pages dynamic `<head>` data for the first time; `attr.meta` remains the static
  layer, and head data is never serialised into `__INITIAL_DATA__`.

  Semantics (signed policy): the loader is bounded by `timeoutMs` (default 3000 ms, positive finite
  only - validated at boot); on deadline expiry with the request still live the render proceeds
  with `headData: undefined` plus an advisory log; a caller abort never proceeds into the renderer;
  an ordinary loader rejection fails the request through the existing error path unless the route
  opts in with `optional: true`. On the streaming branch a head failure terminates the hijacked
  reply deterministically (500 before headers, destroy after) instead of rethrowing into a response
  Fastify no longer owns.

  Type inference: `serviceData()` now returns a phantom-branded `ServiceDataHandler<Result>`
  (type-level only - the runtime value is still the honest service descriptor), and the new
  `HeadDataOf<Route>` helper (exported from `@taujs/server/config` with `HeadAttributes`) infers
  the actual selected service method result for `headContent` typing.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#15](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/15) [`a1a627a`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/a1a627a16fdc9aba8b8d33198be053e092c28053) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - R0-01: export `RenderStreamHandle` (`{ abort(): void; done: Promise<void> }`) as the return
  type of `RenderStream`, and observe `done` at the streaming render call site.

  Both framework renderers already returned `{ abort, done }` at runtime, but the published
  `RenderStream` type promised only `{ abort(): void }`, so the server could not capture `done`.
  A fatal stream error rejects `done`; left unobserved, that surfaced as an `unhandledRejection`
  — which Node's default mode turns into a process-terminating `uncaughtException`. The server
  now captures and acknowledges `done` (fatal errors remain fully handled via the `onError`
  callback; the acknowledgement is also defence in depth if a renderer omits its own handler).

  Type-level breaking change for third-party `RenderStream` implementers: they must now return a
  `done` promise. Both first-party renderers already conform. Bumped `minor` as an additive
  contract type (precedent: V1-05), keeping `@taujs/server` below 1.0.0.

### Patch Changes

- [#15](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/15) [`1b251fa`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/1b251fa10adc055013c9692f8f5c093bcc02ddab) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - R0-02: origin-aware benign-error classification in `HandleRender`. Replaces the broad
  `REGEX.BENIGN_NET_ERR` substring match (now removed) with a strict socket taxonomy — disconnect
  `code`, `AbortError` name, or exact node/undici socket message.

  Fixes a hung-request hole: a `renderSSR` failure is render-origin, so it is benign only when the
  request was actually aborted. A disconnect-shaped render error on a live request previously
  returned silently without sending a response (hanging the request); it now produces a real 500.
  Socket-origin paths (send failure, PassThrough/HTTP socket errors, stream `onError`) use the same
  strict socket check, so an application error whose message merely contains "aborted"/"premature"
  is no longer mistaken for a client disconnect.

- [#15](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/15) [`d629017`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/d629017837553f2b0196aed330cd975edc581689) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - R0-04: eliminate the second process-crash class — a `JSON.stringify` failure thrown from the
  streaming `finish` listener, which runs on a stream tick OUTSIDE the request `try/catch`, so an
  uncaught throw becomes an `uncaughtException` → process exit.

  A single server-owned `serializeInlineData` boundary now serializes the inline
  `window.__INITIAL_DATA__` script for BOTH render modes. It escapes `<` (output is byte-identical
  to the previous inline expression for every valid input, so cached pages are unaffected), treats
  circular references, `BigInt`, a throwing `toJSON`, and `undefined` as deterministic failures, and
  NEVER throws. The SSR path throws an `AppError.internal` into the existing 500 machinery on
  failure; the streaming path logs, records (`recorder.failed`), and terminates the response
  deterministically without a data script — with the entire listener wrapped in a `try/catch` belt.
  The JSON data contract is unchanged (no new serializer dependency).

- [#15](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/15) [`55ace30`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/55ace30371dccde96cc8151c17ec838a11c3b700) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - R0 gate recheck fix — a throwing host `onError` callback can no longer veto stream
  cleanup/settlement:

  - **Renderers** (`@taujs/react`, `@taujs/vue`): every fatal path now routes through a single
    helper that invokes the host `onError` under `try/catch` (the throw is logged and swallowed) and
    ALWAYS runs `controller.fatalAbort`. So a throwing callback — or one called from a shell timer or
    a writable EventEmitter listener — can neither skip cleanup / `done` settlement nor escape as an
    `uncaughtException`; the ORIGINAL render error stays the rejection reason. React additionally no
    longer double-fires `onError` for a fatal writable error.
  - **Server** (`@taujs/server`): the streaming render `onError` callback is now non-throwing for an
    arbitrary/hostile `unknown`. Telemetry (message / kind / normalise / reason) is extracted through
    safe, never-throwing helpers and belted, so formatting a hostile error (a throwing `message`
    getter or `Symbol.toPrimitive`) can no longer prevent the deterministic response teardown
    (500 / socket destroy).

- [#15](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/15) [`9bbc4b7`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/9bbc4b70ee9ab069bd8688338018cace9b753a2d) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - R0 gate-review fixes:

  - **Server:** the streaming render `onError` is the renderer's FATAL channel and is now trusted —
    benign classification uses ACTUAL request-abort state, not the shape (`code`/`name`/exact
    message) of an application-controlled error. This closes an origin-blind reclassification at the
    renderer/server join: a render/data failure that happens to look like a disconnect (e.g.
    `code: 'EPIPE'`, `name: 'AbortError'`, or the exact message `"aborted"`) now enters the failure
    path and is recorded, instead of being silently treated as a client disconnect.
  - **Renderers** (`@taujs/react` upstream, `@taujs/vue` byte-identical drift-copy): the shared UI
    logger is now NON-THROWING — formatting arbitrary `unknown` values (`BigInt`, circular objects,
    symbols, a throwing `toJSON`/`Symbol.toPrimitive`) and calls to a user-provided logger method are
    isolated, so a diagnostic on an error path can never break control flow. The stream controller
    additionally cleans up and settles `done` even if its logger throws. Together these make R0-03's
    always-on `warn`/`error` safe for arbitrary thrown values.

- [#15](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/15) [`caaa160`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/caaa160636e807d7d495180e3284f80345d59323) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - R1-01: add the additive `onRenderError` render-error contract and propagate the request
  `AbortSignal` into route data resolution.

  - **`RenderErrorInfo` + `onRenderError`** are added to the exported `RenderCallbacks` contract. This
    is the advisory, NON-FATAL structured render-error channel (notably for post-shell boundary errors
    the renderer recovers client-side). The server wires it to the request logger at `warn` with a
    message keyed on `recoverable` (`phase`/`recoverable`/`clientRoot`/`url` as structured fields), so a
    recoverable render error is surfaced without being escalated to a fatal response and without
    double-logging a pre-shell error at `error` level (the fatal channel owns that). Callback-policy
    JSDoc documents which callbacks are fatal vs advisory.
  - **AbortSignal into data context.** The request `AbortController.signal` is now threaded into the
    data-resolution context for both the SSR and streaming branches, so loaders can observe client
    disconnects — proven end-to-end by a test that fires the streaming disconnect handler and asserts
    the loader's `ctx.signal.aborted` flips. Non-throwing error formatting on the logging path is
    preserved.

  `onRenderError` is OPTIONAL and non-breaking in either direction (unlike R0-01's `RenderStream`
  return-type change), so existing `RenderCallbacks` users are unaffected — `patch` per the R1-01
  changeset plan, keeping `@taujs/server` below 1.0.0.

- [#15](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/15) [`952afd0`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/952afd04feaf990c256d493ea17c1b7236b4a9a7) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - R2-02 (SEC2): attribute-escape the bootstrap-module `src` at both server emission sites.

  A new server-local `escapeHtmlAttribute` (the server is renderer-agnostic and does not import the
  renderers' `escapeHtml`) now escapes the config-controlled bootstrap-module URL where it is
  interpolated into a `<script … src="…">` tag — the SSR-path tag in `HandleRender` AND
  `injectBootstrapModule` in `Templates` (used by the not-found path). Defence-in-depth: the value is
  config-controlled, so a normal module URL is unchanged; this closes the raw-attribute interpolation.
  `patch` per the versioning cap (no server major/minor for this).

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- [#13](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/13) [`5ffd5b8`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/5ffd5b8f938b12d27b5ec91a16003201c677fa49) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - Fix Vue streaming routes rendering the app twice in dev. The dev introspection stamp
  was written as the first child of `#root` (before the streamed app HTML), which Vue
  hydration reports as a node mismatch - it re-renders the whole app as a duplicate
  sibling of the server-rendered tree. The stamp now lands in `<head>` on the streaming
  path. React is unaffected either way (its hydration skips unexpected scripts) and was
  verified against both playgrounds; production HTML never carried the stamp. The ssr
  path (stamp after the app HTML, tolerated by both renderers) is unchanged.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/10) [`ff2db9a`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/ff2db9aebfe3da2cd987dbfab6c8da0141150608) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - Export the render-contract types for framework renderer packages (V1-05):
  `RenderCallbacks`, `RenderSSR`, `RenderStream`, `RenderModule`, `RendererLogger`.
  Framework packages (e.g. `@taujs/vue`) can now type-check their `createRenderer(...)`
  output against `RenderModule` cast-free. `RenderStream`'s sink parameter is typed as a
  node `Writable` (which the server has always passed as a `PassThrough`, and both renderers
  have always consumed), and `opts.logger` on `RenderSSR`/`RenderStream` uses the new minimal
  `RendererLogger` structural type in place of the internal `Logs`. Additive and
  backward-compatible; the previously-unexported `StreamSink` type is removed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`b82056a`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/b82056a7667a06dd6dd64e9f3ca436221952242b) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0A-03: add `createRequestGraph(config, { source, emittedAt, serviceRegistry? })` — a pure, deterministic, no-I/O serialisation of the resolved config into request-graph schema v1: apps, routes (effective render/hydrate values with `defaulted` flags, specificity, conservative auth/CSP blocks, declared `data.kind`), services with declared param/result schema kinds and `usedBy` edges when a registry is supplied (`null` otherwise), security summary, fallthrough model, and a structured warnings registry. Declared route → service edges are read via the P0A-01/P0A-02 metadata accessors — no data handler is ever executed. Exported from the package root.

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`c52b80b`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/c52b80b72c13fc9acbd6b170f4bf7fbc24bbadc3) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0B-03: dev introspection files, overlay endpoints, and the `introspection` config surface. Dev boot now writes `node_modules/.taujs/dev.json` (bootId, per-boot token, pid, actual bound socket, artifact paths — removed on graceful close) and mirrors the in-memory rings to `traces.ndjson` / `logs.ndjson` / `observations.json` with atomic non-fatal writes. `/__taujs/graph|observations|traces` (plain + SSE) and `POST /__taujs/beacon` are registered only inside the structural dev gate, each enforcing loopback remote-address → Host validation (DNS-rebinding safe) → per-boot token, in that order. New public config: `introspection.allowNonLoopback` (relaxes only the remote-address check and shouts in the boot summary) and `introspection.redaction.denyKeys`/`replaceDefaultDenyKeys`.

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`fb34d5f`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/fb34d5f0d5ef2e2f121ac91ff219e8fa5c13150b) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0A-04: wire request-graph emission. Dev boot writes `node_modules/.taujs/graph.json` (`source: 'boot'`, registry-enriched) from a Fastify `onListen` hook — registered only inside the structural development gate via lazy dynamic import, so production never loads the introspection code at all. `taujsBuild` writes `dist/.taujs/graph.json` (`source: 'build'`, `services: null`) after successful builds. All artifact writes go through a shared `writeTaujsArtifact` helper: directory ensured, atomic tmp+rename, and non-fatal by contract — a failure warns once per boot and never breaks boot or build.

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`2368d09`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/2368d09619aa1b89d4f0fb9546b48925dde61526) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0A-01: add `createServiceData()` / `serviceData()` — typed sugar over the service-descriptor best practice. The returned handler is an ordinary async `DataHandler` that builds the `ServiceDescriptor` at request time (runtime dispatch through `fetchInitialData` is unchanged) and carries non-enumerable `{ serviceName, serviceMethod }` metadata readable via the internal `getServiceDataMetadata()` accessor, so tooling can see declared route → service edges without executing handlers. Exported from `@taujs/server/config` alongside `defineService`.

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`6f557bd`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/6f557bdd2fd49c1f4c5b4af9ec020933aebac7a1) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0B-01: trace context is now created in a shared `onRequest` hook (registered deliberately before the auth hook), so every request — rendered, fallthrough, or asset-like — has a `traceId` before route matching. Behaviour addition: fallthrough (client-rendered) responses now carry the `x-trace-id` response header, and fallthrough logs carry the request's trace context. Rendered-route behaviour is observably unchanged; `handleRender`/`handleNotFound` invoked without the hook (direct composition) behave exactly as before.

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`0bf8d9b`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/0bf8d9b7adec50ae1292f02971a3ba9b4407ced4) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0B-02: `TraceRecorder` interface (no-op default) with a dev-only ring-buffer assembler behind the structural gate. Rendered, fallthrough, failed, and aborted requests each assemble a trace record (200-trace ring) with URL hygiene — pathname + surviving query key names only, denylisted keys dropped entirely, values never stored. The request child logger is teed into a logs annex (2000-record ring, debug excluded, redaction-filtered meta), and observed service edges accumulate into an observations document (shapes deferred — the `serviceCall` event deliberately never carries result data). Recorder calls are synchronous fire-and-forget and safety-wrapped: a throwing recorder implementation warns once and never affects a response.

### Patch Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`f7035b6`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/f7035b6e8b037e246e4a5c91c305ad30b58db81f) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0A-02: `defineService` now retains the declared schema shape of each normalised method as non-enumerable metadata — `{ params, result }`, each `{ declared, kind? }` where `kind` is `'parse' | 'function'` (the only distinction `NarrowSchema` honestly reveals; never claimed as "zod"). Bare-function and schemaless entries record `{ declared: false }`. Runtime behaviour is unchanged: `runSchema` dispatch, container freezing, and method identity are all as before; the metadata is readable only via the internal `getServiceMethodMetadata()` accessor (exported from `@taujs/server/config`), so tooling can see declared param/result schemas without executing handlers.

- [#6](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/pull/6) [`bc98103`](https://github.com/aoede3/taujs/commit/bc981030836f811028518b0d2c471e3d04c1c5b9) Thanks [@aoede3](https://github.com/aoede3)! - P0B-04: dev boots stamp `window.__TAUJS_TRACE_ID__` + the per-boot token and inject the beacon script (nonce-aware) into rendered pages — alongside `__INITIAL_DATA__` on SSR, in the head write on streaming, and into the fallthrough shell, which has no data script to ride with. The script listens to `hydrateApp`'s internal events and POSTs `{ traceId, ok, ms?, error? }` to `/__taujs/beacon` once, with the token header. Present only when the structural dev gate holds; production HTML never carries any of it.

It is imported at runtime (logging, network, and server bootstrap) but was previously undeclared and resolved only via package hoisting — which fails under pnpm's strict `node_modules` layout and for consumers installing the package on its own.
